# Utah-County-Parks
This project was to code and automate a task that anyone would be able to use. Specifically with my task you are able to find parks within any county in Utah and be able to analyze and compare their statistics to other parks.
To be able to use the tool you download the parks data, identify your variables you want to use, and then continue to use the functions using any park you want to analyze and compare with each other.
